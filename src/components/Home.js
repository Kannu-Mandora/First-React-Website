          <b> This is a small blog on Home section related to Web Developer. I hope you will enjoy it.</b> </p>

        <p className='flex my-3'>A web developer is a programmer who develops World Wide Web applications using a client server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Node.js, Go or Java in the server, and http for communications between client and server. A web developer may specialize in client-side applications (front-end developer), server-side applications (back-end developer), or both (full-stack developer).</p>

        <p className='flex my-3'>There are no formal educational or license requirements to become a web developer. However, many colleges and trade schools offer coursework in web development. There are also many tutorials and articles which teach web development, often freely available on the web - for example, on JavaScript.

          Even though there are no formal requirements, web development projects require web developers to have advanced knowledge and skills such as:

          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
          Server/client side architecture like all or some of the above mentioned
          Programming/coding/scripting in one of the many server-side languages or frameworks (e.g., Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, Go, Java, ASP.NET, Node.js)
          Ability to utilize a database
          Creating single page application with the use of front-end tools such as Vue, React.js or Angular</p>

        <p className='flex my-3'>In the industrial design field of human computer interaction, a user interface (UI) is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur. The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end, while the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators decision-making process. Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer operating systems, hand tools, heavy machinery operator controls, and process controls. The design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to, or involve such disciplines as, ergonomics and psychology.</p>

        <p className='flex my-3'>Generally, the goal of user interface design is to produce a user interface that makes it easy, efficient, and enjoyable (user-friendly) to operate a machine in the way which produces the desired result (i.e. maximum usability). This generally means that the operator needs to provide minimal input to achieve the desired output, and also that the machine minimizes undesired outputs to the user.</p>

        <p className='flex my-3'>User interfaces are composed of one or more layers, including a human-machine interface (HMI) that interfaces machines with physical input hardware such as keyboards, mice, or game pads, and output hardware such as computer monitors, speakers, and printers. A device that implements an HMI is called a human interface device (HID). Other terms for human machine interfaces are man machine interface (MMI) and, when the machine in question is a computer, human computer interface. Additional UI layers may interact with one or more human senses, including: tactile UI (touch), visual UI (sight), auditory UI (sound), olfactory UI (smell), equilibria UI (balance), and gustatory UI (taste).</p>

        <p className='flex my-3'>Composite user interfaces (CUIs) are UIs that interact with two or more senses. The most common CUI is a graphical user interface (GUI), which is composed of a tactile UI and a visual UI capable of displaying graphics. When sound is added to a GUI, it becomes a multimedia user interface (MUI). There are three broad categories of CUI: standard, virtual and augmented. Standard CUI use standard human interface devices like keyboards, mice, and computer monitors. When the CUI blocks out the real world to create a virtual reality, the CUI is virtual and uses a virtual reality interface. When the CUI does not block out the real world and creates augmented reality, the CUI is augmented and uses an augmented reality interface. When a UI interacts with all human senses, it is called a qualia interface, named after the theory of qualia.[citation needed] CUI may also be classified by how many senses they interact with as either an X-sense virtual reality interface or X-sense augmented reality interface, where X is the number of senses interfaced with. For example, a Smell-O-Vision is a 3-sense (3S) Standard CUI with visual display, sound and smells; when virtual reality interfaces interface with smells and touch it is said to be a 4-sense (4S) virtual reality interface; and when augmented reality interfaces interface with smells and touch it is said to be a 4-sense (4S) augmented reality interface.</p>
